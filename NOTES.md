Things I've thought about today that might be worth learning:
  - patterns for hooking up postgres to express
  - testing database interactions with express
  - end to end tests for the api with express (also using a database?)
  - repository pattern

TODO:
  - 2x2 grid homepage
    - reset.scss?
  - ghost blogs ported to medium (maybe use github to host markdown and 'import story' in medium.  Either way, i want one place for blog content to live.)
  - host the fucker on DO                    (https://amodernstory.com/2015/06/07/creating-a-website-with-nodejs-nginx-and-digital-ocean/)
  - Blog links on site
  - cool back button
  - cors?  (make sure only my api can make reqeusts)

Nice to have:
  - local authentication
  - oauth
  - sessions?  (cookies vs in-memory vs redis)
    - wtf is a cookiejar                     (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/31270461/what-is-the-difference-between-cookie-and-cookiejar
